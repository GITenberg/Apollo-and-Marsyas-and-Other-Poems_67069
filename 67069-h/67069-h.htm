<span class="i0">And give the right of flaying with a nod?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh who when radiant noontide’s last note dies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And darkness with its mystery draws near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall bid the strains of twilight not arise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That fill the soul with wistfulness or fear?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Man gives his love in turn, he knows not why,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To sun or gloom according to his mood;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His ear, his heart, alternately is woo’d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Nature’s carol or by Nature’s sigh.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Marsyas’ reed-pipe and Apollo’s lyre<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Make endless competition upon earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As men prefer the charm of vague desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or charm of bright serenity and mirth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">{2}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But not alone the wistful strains of eve<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mean unseen Marsyas speaking to the heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor is he near, in Nature and in Art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone where yearning makes the bosom heave.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Often in tones more passionate he wails,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pensive no more but fiercely wild and shrill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fills the soul with rapture as it quails,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And charms us with the very fear of ill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wherever lonely Nature claims her right<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon man’s love, and her wild fitful voice<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With flute-like wailings makes his ear rejoice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the wild music of a stormy night;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wherever haunting Fancy fills the gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With ghostly sounds, with evil spirits’ sobs,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And, half seduced, the heart with vague fear throbs;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Create new realms as wild as are his own,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With shapes of fear, with dread fantastic spells,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who shrinks with blinking eyelids from the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When with the dawn he leaps on laughing waves,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sounds which that great Dorian God, whose glance<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Kindles the blushes of the pale sea foam,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Above the mutability of things;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And though I think, if you but listen well,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That here, upon this many voiced earth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There be less sounds of carol and of mirth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than sounds of sigh and moan and dirge and knell;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And though what here I offer echoes less<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Apollo’s lyre than Marsyas’ reedy fife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose fitful wailing in the wilderness<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sounds through the chinks and crannies of my life,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Apollo’s name is sweet, and I were loth<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To spend that night in any rival’s arms!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rock, hard and wind-swept, was my marriage bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wilderness my bride; the starry sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My roof; the distant, interrupted howl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beasts of prey my nuptial lullaby.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before me lay the waste, strewn here and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ribs of men and camels, or the wreck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of perished cities; yea, and thirst and pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vaguely measured sum. But in my soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice of thunder cried: “Push on, push on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the waste, Porphyrion! thou art still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too near to human haunts, too far from God!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I pushed on; and in an empty tomb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a deserted city of the dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I made my lair, alone with stones and God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Living off locusts and such scanty herbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As grew in clefts of rock and empty wells.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh what a silence, what a loneliness!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The temple columns and the huge carved stones<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No moving shadow crossed them save my own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, like a leper whom his sores have doomed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oh, it was hard! For knowing that the Fiend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would come ere long to scare and tempt me back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To human haunts, I sought with prayer, and scourge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thirst, and hunger, and restricted sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To arm myself against him and his strength;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And come he did. He prowled at first at night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaped as a roaring lion, round and round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lonely cell; but his re-echoing roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deterred me not, nor stopped a single prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he came with soft insidious step<br /></span>
<span class="i0">During my sleep, and strove to tempt the flesh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In woman’s guise&mdash;yea, in thy very shape&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sought to lure me to caress and kiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taking thy face, thy eyes, thy very voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all their beauty and their blandishment;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I defied him, and he howling fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And changed his plan. He made the solid ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lurch ever and anon beneath my feet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He made me shiver in the blazing sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mortal cold; and sometimes, in the dusk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He made the huge stone heads of sphinxes nod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gibber as I passed them. Oh, for years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wrestled with him in the awful waste;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A man of little learning; one whose youth<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I turned with grimy hands, therein to learn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The will and orders of a jealous God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A God of wrath, a God whose unseen hand<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unseemly for the most part, which divert<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirit from obedience, and prevent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The growth of labour’s fruit; and God allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I should prosper in my worldly wealth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that the name of Abraham Carew<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One child alone, one twining clinging flower&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Edith, my latest born&mdash;remained unnipped,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Obeyed the dire injunction of the Lord,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With golding streakings, just as rays of sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light up the seaweed in a tide-left pool,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It was the dead of night: I lay awake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the soundless darkness, all at once,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While on my flesh the hair from fear stood up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard the awful voice: it cried, “Arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take up thy knife, and sacrifice thy child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom I bestowed; for I the Lord thy God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am a jealous God, and bid thee strike.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Beneath religion’s heel: for I believed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To tell her all&mdash;to ask her for her life&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To call on her obedience to submit&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shift upon her shoulders half the weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of agony and horror; but I looked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her face and set aside the plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Misdoubting woman’s strength. In Edith’s eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw a strange suspicious look&mdash;a look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which told me that the tempest in my soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was finding outward vent upon my face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I caught her watching me, and understood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That if I struck not soon, perchance my arm<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There was a spot beside the sedgy stream,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The thunder’s distant rumble met the ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We reached the lonely river-bank. I stopped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was about to do it, when she laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hand upon my arm with a caress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And asked me in her sweet familiar voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pluck a water-lily, which I did,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then walked on, for somehow I was balked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not do it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">With the fall of night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pent-up tempest burst; and in its roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seemed to hear God’s formidable wrath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard it in the howling of the wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard it in the pelting of the rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the windows; and each rattling peal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each burst of rolling echo in the dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which made me cower like a chastened hound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recalled me to obedience. But the flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strong rebellious flesh, oh how it writhed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the spirit! How the natural love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The common human instinct, fought and fought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, backed by Satan’s whisper, held its own!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length the spirit conquered, and I rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do the will of God; but, in my crushed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And humbled anguish, I implored the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stay my lifted arm, and at the last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save her life as Isaac’s had been saved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I went up the stairs, as if each step<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were a delay, a respite, and a hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sought the chamber where my Edith slept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The walk had worn her limbs; her sleep was deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The storm had not aroused her; nor did I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I kissed her, and I slew her; for the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did not vouchsafe to stay His servant’s arm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For one short moment after she was dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought perchance that He would bring her back<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As intimate as of old; and as no claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of work or pleasure summoned me elsewhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He let me roam through Greece with him, and share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own strong daily life&mdash;the sheer reverse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my accustomed life of waste, and worse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than waste, the aimless life of which my soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was more than sick; it had become so foul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had an iron will; his hand was rough;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart was gentle. God had used strong stuff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In making him&mdash;weak stuff in making me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I was not worthless utterly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spite all my sins there were some better strings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In my weak heart; the wind of angels’ wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made them vibrate&mdash;but with faint echo, like<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Æolian chords that gusts too fitful strike.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine is a double nature, which depends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wholly on its surroundings, and which blends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With good or evil, with the low or high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the same drifting weak facility.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Strongclyffe’s hands my nature’s worthier side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone found vent; pure tastes that had not died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew strong, while half-forgotten culture found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sudden use, and from all things around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Increased its wealth. I think that he enjoyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His power over me; his strong soul toyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With my soft malleable mind, which had,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of degradations many and sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Affinities of taste, and could admire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And understand him. Oh what strength and fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath his quiet ways! What scorn could burst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his cold lip! what ceaseless ceaseless thirst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had for knowledge! Even as my mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew intimate with his, new worlds defined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their shape on my horizon, like the grey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint, shadowy Greek Isles which far away<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loomed through the mists of dawn, but which became,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we approached them in the sunrise flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each minute more distinct.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">We seldom stayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long in one self-same spot; but we obeyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The needs of Strongclyffe’s studies, which entailed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Research in many places; and we sailed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From isle to isle, or rode from place to place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in the less-known parts of Greece and Thrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now in rocky Lydia. Oh, what fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where men dig gold, what far Golconda yields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such wealth, such gems, as those impoverished plains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which the spade turns up the scant remains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bygone genius; where the obedient earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Summoned to yield her buried dead, gives birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if compelled by an enchanter’s rod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what is ever young&mdash;now to some god<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all his strength and beauty, now to some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fantastic child of Pan, who seems fresh come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From dewy woods that long have ceased to be?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Strongclyffe had the art to make one see<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hidden through the seen&mdash;to reconstruct<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past life and loveliness, and to conduct<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mind through perished worlds; and everywhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He showed the same keen interest and a rare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Persistence of research. Yet what he did<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed somehow trifling; oft I thought it hid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Higher preoccupation&mdash;some great aim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which time was ripening; so that when there came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One day a sudden change in him&mdash;when all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was thrown aside, and when I heard him call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my help, with triumph on his lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a great enterprise which should eclipse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even the greatest, I received his words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not wholly unprepared.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">How my heart’s chords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vibrate as I recall them! ’Twas about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The third year’s close; and we were sitting out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon our terrace looking on the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Thyna, after sundown. Purposely,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I now fancy, Strongclyffe had led on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our idle talk to what might yet be won<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back by mankind, of the great wreck we call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Antiquity; and then we talked of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">{92}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That splendid half of antique art which must<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the materials used have turned to dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almost as soon as did the artist’s hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where be thy works, Apelles? where now stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Phidias, thy gold and ivory gems, renowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the broad world? and where stands she who owned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As her fit seat the new-born Parthenon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy gold and ivory Pallas? What would man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not give to-day if only he could scan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one short glimpse the splendour of that shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Fancy’s restorations vainly ape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he for one short minute could behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ivory face, that drapery of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Phidias modelled it?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">“And yet,” I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“That Art was not so frail; for I have read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That that same effigy of Pallas, spared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From age to age, existed unimpaired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the Crusaders, under Baldwin, took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sacked Constantinople.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">A strange look<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashed out from Strongclyffe’s eyes. “There is no truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that old tale,” he answered; “and Time’s tooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still spared the statue when it many a year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had gnawed the bones of Baldwin in his bier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay, and of Baldwin’s sons.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">“How know you that?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I asked.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">He left the bench on which we sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a strange excitement he began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pace the terrace. “I am not the man,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cried, “to make rash statements; yet I say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deliberately, Percy, that to-day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Pallas still exists. Oh, Earth has still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surprises for mankind; and with God’s will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And patient work, the world shall see her yet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think not that I am mad: wait till I set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My proofs before your eyes. When you behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The text in John Ionides, the old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Byzantine Chronicler, which had defied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All guesses to this day, and by its side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A certain passage in the life of Paul<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Trebizond&mdash;and when you’ve counted all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The links of evidence which year by year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have augmented both at home and here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until I now have found the very spot&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then call me mad. ’Tis years since I have got<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The certainty that long ere Baldwin’s sack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Emperor, in fear of some attack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the palace, had her safe conveyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By vessel to a distance, and (by aid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of trusty workmen) carefully concealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In crypts beneath a temple. Nought revealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret at the time; the Emperor died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon after; and, none caring to unhide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The statue, men forgot her. But where lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The temple&mdash;or the ruins which to-day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No doubt replace it? Here I seemed to lose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My way and reach mere nothing. All my clues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led to one spot&mdash;Thelopis; and that spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of all my search, I found it not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, with what patience in these three long years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have I not sought! Oh, with what hopes and fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have I not searched the present and the past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find that place Thelopis! And at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have found out. Thelopis was a town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If town it could be called, that was burnt down<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten centuries ago, and where has grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The present village Thos&mdash;the place that is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nearest the temple of Peripolis:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The temple is Peripolis. And see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The distance and direction both agree:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The passage says, ‘a five days’ eastward sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then three days of road.’ No clues now fail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There under Peripolis, girt round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By solitude and silence, will be found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gold and ivory Pallas. Oh, I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you will answer that she long ago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must have become mere shapeless mouldering dust&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That after seven centuries she must<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have blent with earth; and yet I say she stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As grand and splendid as when all Greek lands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First hailed her beauty! Do you think that they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who used such pains, in safety to convey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hide her in that distant spot, would spare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slight pains needed to exclude the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ward away the damp? Again I say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She lives&mdash;she lives!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">And so the following day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We started for Peripolis&mdash;a long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And arduous journey; for it lies among<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild unfrequented mountains, in a small<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fever-stricken plain. The hills are all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possessed by tribes which, though uncouth and wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are not unfriendly. When you once have toiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the last defiles, and behold the lone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still distant ruins below you, that seem thrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There to die slow, like those whom in its haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A routed host abandons in the waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There creeps across your soul a sort of fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sense of isolation such as ne’er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has filled your heart. The broken columns throw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their shadows on bare shingle; nought will grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For miles around save thin scorched grass that feeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A few lean goats, and some few clumps of reeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where there is water. Oh, the tract around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speaks utter desolation; and we found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The task not easy even to collect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The workmen we required. The heaps of wrecked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weed-grown marble where the spade was tried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had more than once been searched, and seemed to hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought worth men’s pains&mdash;at most some shattered bit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Greco-Roman sculpture; but we lit<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On some strange crypts; and in a few more days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We had discovered a bewildering maze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of subterranean chambers, large and small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And catacomb-like passages, which all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were cut in soft dry stone, and stretched away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far underground, beyond the ruins that lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the sun’s light; and all were wholly bare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strongclyffe at once, pretending not to care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For empty crypts, employed the men elsewhere;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While he and I, by torch-light and alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Explored the maze. But sometimes, as loose stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obstructed here and there the way, we had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A boy to help&mdash;a dull half-witted lad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whom we felt no fear. For days we sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With boundless care, but all our searching brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing to light; we sounded every wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We grew familiar with each inch of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lonely crypts; and even Strongclyffe seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To grow depressed. But suddenly there gleamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh ardour in his eyes: “Look there!” he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And showed me something like an arrow’s head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut in the wall; a small, scarce visible mark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which led to others like it through the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perplexing crypt; and where the last marks were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We scrutinized the wall with greater care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found its surface rougher, as if there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It had been tampered with. “This is the spot,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He whispered. “She is here;” and having got<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pick, he struck. And as, beneath the stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Vulcan’s hammer once, the aching brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Zeus was cleft for Pallas’ birth, so now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stricken cloven stone exposed to sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long-sought Goddess; and the flickering light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the red torch flashed in a tremulous flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her golden breastplate as she stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intact, in all the glory and the glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her incomparable beauty.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">So<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was she discovered; I must now compel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My weak and miserable self to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How she was lost. There was no time to lose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we agreed, or rather Strongclyffe chose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he should start at once for the chief town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that wild province, as he long had known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The there commanding Pasha, to obtain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A guard of men; while I was to remain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To watch the workmen. He was to be back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within three days. Alas! I had no lack<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of buoyant thoughts at first; my soul was filled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With our immense success; my nerves still thrilled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With triumph and delight; and the first day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Strongclyffe’s absence lightly passed away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men worked on as usual, and my mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conceived no fear. But when the sun declined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There crept across my spirit, with the tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of slowly creeping shadow as day died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A vague uneasiness; and my hands felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the revolver hanging at my belt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought; and I remembered that when we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had found the prize, we were not two but three.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boy had seen the whole; and though I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he was dull of wit and had no clue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find the spot again in that vast maze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hidden crypts and subterranean ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wished he had not seen. The men had gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to their distant huts. I sat alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a broken column; one by one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The large stars twinkled forth from out the blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shattered standing columns dusky grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And very solemn; and the wakening bat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to flit around me. As I sat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought of Strongclyffe’s generosity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he had said ere setting out that I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His faithful friend, must have an equal share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the world’s praise; that it would not be fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">O God!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">I gave a strangled shout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fell, dragged backwards by a noose about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My throat. Three men were kneeling on my chest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Binding me tight with cords, while others pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All round about me, uttering no sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if all dumb. When I was firmly bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All save my feet, which, purposely let loose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let me walk, were in a running noose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of the men addressed me: “Listen well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what I say,” he said. “If you rebel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We take your life; and none can help you now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have no wish to harm you; but we know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you have found a treasure, and have got<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clue. Lead on.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">“I understand you not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I said.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">He took a pistol from his sash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And held it at my ear. “Come, be not rash,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, “but lead the way.” Oh, would to God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he had fired! But though like a mere clod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I still moved not, he did not fire, but placed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more the gleaming pistol in his waist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whispered with the others; then they drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cords still tighter round my limbs, and threw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My unresisting body on the bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In my own hut hard by. “Mark well,” they said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Ere dawn we come. Thy blood be on thy head!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At first I had no thoughts, nought but the sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of cramped and swelling limbs, and an intense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desire to burst my bonds. But by-and-by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sense of infinite calamity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to weigh upon me; and at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sense came home that time was slipping fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I was there to make an awful choice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twixt Life and Death; and then an inner voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to state the argument each way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not clearly, coldly, as I may to-day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do in this letter, but confused, close-pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repeated and repeated in my breast<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every shape, until my weary brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exhausted by the conflict and the pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yielded to sleep. And even in my sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The struggle still went on; I felt it keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possession of my dreams, and take the shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of shifting nightmare, leaving no escape.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the glorious Pallas, calm no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But threatening and terrific, kneeling o’er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My prostrate body, with red eyes that gleamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fiery in the darkness, that it seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if one of the Furies had put on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her golden panoply. Then, wild and wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the face of Strongclyffe looming out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From a black whirling gulf; and heard him shout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some spent swimmer half sucked down.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think I woke, and with a vague despair<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To add to his small store of things that lift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul to higher spheres&mdash;a gift from which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will flow perennial charm for poor and rich,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That some great treasure lost long, long ago&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Because a certain man had grudged the cost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his brief life to save it, that man’s name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever handed down in scorn and shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would be all nations’ by-word. Who can say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That some great work which man enjoys to-day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Melos statue, Hamlet or Macbeth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the Gioconda&mdash;was not saved from death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some great unknown peril that it ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By some unknown, unthanked and nameless man<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of something rarer yet, wouldst have the face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give the world thy mean half-wasted life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which it can do nought? Thou hast no wife,<br /></span>

<p>“We should have to go to great names among contemporary poets before we
found a volume of verse with a message so clear and so touching....
There is in the lines quoted a directness of speech due partly to the
situation of the writer and partly to the rare gift which, above all
others, makes a man a poet&mdash;a gift of truthful and sincere utterance. We
have quoted from the more personal parts of the book because we have
been greatly touched by them. But it is on the dramatic power displayed
in such poems as ‘The Raft’ that the writer’s position will have to
rest.”&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“The power which every capable reader of Mr. Lee-Hamilton’s previous
work, must have recognised is still more apparent in the <i>New
Medusa</i>.... The imaginative power which reproduces and dramatises a
certain mood of mind is very noteworthy. It is in this faculty of what
may be called psychography, of drawing the landscape of moods with
atmosphere and environment suitable and complete, that Mr.
Lee-Hamilton’s poetic power chiefly consists.”&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
